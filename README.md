## I'm Lucas Soares!

I am a **DevOps Infrastructure Analyst II** with nearly 3 years of experience in software development and infrastructure automation. Currently working at [4Linux](https://4linux.com.br/), my focus is on ensuring scalability, resilience, and operational efficiency across all projects.

My skill set spans a variety of cutting-edge technologies, including **Kubernetes**, **Docker**, **Ansible**, **Terraform**, and **CI/CD pipelines**, implemented on platforms like **AWS** and **GCP**. I have hands-on experience with container orchestration through Kubernetes and Amazon EKS, as well as crafting secure environments, configuring VPNs, and enforcing robust security policies. In addition, I have supported critical operations, guided server migrations, and maintained smooth transitions across different infrastructure setups.

On the backend side, I specialize in **TypeScript**, **TypeORM**, and the integration of message queues like **MQTT**. I ensure adherence to **SOLID principles** while continuously exploring **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** and software architecture best practices. Beyond infrastructure and backend expertise, I stay updated on frontend frameworks such as **React.js** and **React Native**, aiming to deliver an end-to-end, automated, and scalable software delivery lifecycle.

Letâ€™s connect and explore new opportunities to drive **innovation**, **efficiency**, and **security** in your next project!
